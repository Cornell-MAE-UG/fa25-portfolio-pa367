## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/ghpfp.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Parker Ashworth, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University.  My experience includes  modeling, prototyping, and hands-on analysis of real mechanical systems through coursework, lab work and personal projects. I have a strong desire to keep learning, refining my technical skills, and to take on challenging engineering problems. I’m excited to gain practical experience that pushes me to grow as an engineer and contribute to real-world development.
